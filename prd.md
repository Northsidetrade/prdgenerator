# üìò Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## üß≠ Overview

The **Automated PRD Generator** is a tool that transforms short-form user input (natural language or structured prompts) into fully structured, high-quality PRDs. It will support TDD/BDD formatting, semantic structuring, and markdown exports to streamline the software planning process for technical and non-technical founders alike.

This product is intended to be built as a **microservice** with a REST API and/or interactive UI, leveraging LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, or Ollama), contextual memory, and prompt templates grounded in the **SSCS framework**.

---

## üéØ Goals

1. Enable users to generate accurate and complete PRDs from minimal input
2. Produce TDD/BDD-ready content that integrates directly into agile workflows
3. Ensure outputs are aligned with **SSCS v2.0**
4. Provide markdown and JSON export options
5. Support UI + API access modes for integration into other dev tools

## üß© Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Prompt-Based Input** | Users fill out a short form or prompt the system in natural language |
| **TDD/BDD Formatting Engine** | Output PRDs using test-first development structure |
| **SSCS-Compliant Output** | Structure documents using the Semantic Seed Coding Standards v2.0 |
| **Markdown/JSON Export** | Allow users to download or copy in markdown or JSON format |
| **API Access** | RESTful endpoint to programmatically generate PRDs |
| **User Profiles & Project History** | Store previous prompts and generated PRDs tied to user accounts |
| **Template System** | Offer templates for common software types (CRUD App, Marketplace, AI Agent, etc.) |
| **LLM Provider Flexibility** | Support OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and fine-tuned models for generation |

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (UI Form + Markdown Preview)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 or Claude 3 Sonnet via API
- **Hosting**: Vercel (frontend), Railway/DigitalOcean (backend)

### API Endpoints (REST)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/generate-prd` | Accepts input and returns a full PRD |
| `GET` | `/user/:id/history` | Fetches past PRDs for logged-in user |
| `POST` | `/save-prd` | Saves a generated PRD under a project |

---

## üß† Data Model (Simplified)

```json
{
  "users": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "email": "string",
    "name": "string"
  },
  "projects": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "user_id": "uuid",
    "title": "string",
    "input_prompt": "text",
    "generated_prd": "markdown",
    "created_at": "timestamp"
  }
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Example User Flow

1. User logs in
2. Enters a short-form description (e.g. ‚ÄúBuild a task manager that learns user priorities‚Äù)
3. Selects output format (Markdown / JSON)
4. Optionally selects a template (CRUD app, AI bot, eCommerce)
5. Clicks "Generate"
6. Gets a TDD/BDD-formatted PRD
7. Can export/download or save to workspace

---

## üìì BDD Test Cases (Gherkin Syntax)

```gherkin
Feature: Generate PRD from user input

Scenario: User submits valid prompt
  Given I am a logged-in user
  When I submit a prompt for a product idea
  Then I should receive a markdown-formatted PRD
  And the PRD should include sections: Overview, Goals, Features, Data Model, and Test Cases

Scenario: User selects export as JSON
  Given I have generated a PRD
  When I choose JSON as the export format
  Then I should receive a correctly structured JSON document

Scenario: System fails to generate PRD
  Given the AI model is unavailable
  When I submit a prompt
  Then I should receive an error message suggesting retry
```

---

## üìè Acceptance Criteria

| Criteria | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ‚úÖ TDD/BDD Section | PRD must include sections formatted for test-driven development |
| ‚úÖ SSCS Compliant | Document structure follows SSCS standards |
| ‚úÖ Export Formats | Users can export PRD as Markdown and JSON |
| ‚úÖ LLM Prompt Reliability | Generation must succeed 95%+ of the time with valid prompts |
| ‚úÖ Response Time | Under 3 seconds for generation on average |
| ‚úÖ Save and Reuse | Users can access historical prompts and regenerate PRDs |

---

## üîê Security & Privacy

- Supabase Auth for user management
- Rate-limiting on `/generate-prd` endpoint
- All PRDs are user-owned, stored securely with role-based access

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Future Enhancements

- Support for multilingual PRD generation
- Embedding in VS Code / Cody IDE plugin
- Real-time collaboration (co-editing PRD with a team)
- Smart Suggestion Mode (suggest test cases based on features)
