Here's a **detailed Agile Sprint Plan** for building the **Automated PRD Generator**, aligned with **TDD/BDD practices** and **Semantic Seed Coding Standards (SSCS v2.0)**. The project is scoped to be delivered over **3 sprints (2 weeks each)** for an MVP, assuming a small team of 2â€“4 engineers and 1 PM/UX.

# ðŸš€ Sprint Plan: Automated PRD Generator (MVP)

| Sprint | Focus Area | Duration | Sprint Goal |
|--------|------------|----------|-------------|
| Sprint 1 | Setup & Core Backend | 2 weeks | Establish foundational backend services, database, and prompt generation logic |
| Sprint 2 | PRD Rendering & Export | 2 weeks | Implement formatting engine, markdown/JSON export, and API coverage |
| Sprint 3 | UI, Templates, Auth & Polish | 2 weeks | Build user UI, auth, template system, and QA for release readiness |

---

## ðŸ“… Sprint 1: Setup & Core Backend

**Goal:** Functional backend service that accepts prompts and returns a raw PRD document using LLM.

### ðŸ§© Epics & User Stories

| Story ID | User Story | Size (Fibonacci) | Acceptance Criteria |
|----------|------------|------------------|----------------------|
| BE-1 | As a dev, I want a FastAPI backend project scaffolded with linting, testing, and CI | 2 | App scaffolds with `pytest`, `black`, and GitHub Actions working |
| BE-2 | As a user, I want to submit an idea prompt and get back a basic PRD | 3 | PRD returns with sections: Overview, Goals, Features |
| BE-3 | As a dev, I want to call OpenAI/Claude to generate PRDs from structured prompts | 2 | Model responds with valid content from system prompt |
| BE-4 | As a dev, I want to store prompts and PRDs in a Supabase PostgreSQL DB | 3 | Data saved with correct relationships between user â†’ project â†’ PRD |
| BE-5 | As a dev, I want to write BDD tests for PRD generation | 2 | `pytest-bdd` covers positive, edge, and fail cases with mocks |

### âœ… Deliverables

- FastAPI app
- `/generate-prd` API
- Model call (OpenAI/Claude)
- PostgreSQL schema
- BDD test coverage
- CI setup with auto-linting

## ðŸ“… Sprint 2: PRD Rendering & Export

**Goal:** Convert model output into SSCS-compliant markdown/JSON documents with formatting controls.

### ðŸ§© Epics & User Stories

| Story ID | User Story | Size | Acceptance Criteria |
|----------|------------|------|----------------------|
| FE-1 | As a user, I want to view the generated PRD as a markdown preview | 3 | Live-rendered preview appears on frontend |
| FE-2 | As a user, I want to export my PRD as a `.md` or `.json` file | 2 | Export/download options available |
| BE-6 | As a dev, I want to implement markdown and JSON serialization | 3 | Formatting engine produces clean SSCS outputs |
| BE-7 | As a dev, I want the PRD to be stored with export format metadata | 1 | DB supports format enum: markdown, json |
| BE-8 | As a dev, I want to generate unit and integration tests for export logic | 2 | TDD coverage includes all formats, edge cases, failures |

### âœ… Deliverables

- Export button (MD + JSON)
- PRD rendering pipeline
- Export endpoint and download logic
- 100% test coverage for formats

---

## ðŸ“… Sprint 3: UI, Auth, Templates & QA

**Goal:** Implement end-to-end UX with form input, auth, templates, and polish for MVP delivery.

### ðŸ§© Epics & User Stories

| Story ID | User Story | Size | Acceptance Criteria |
|----------|------------|------|----------------------|
| UI-1 | As a user, I want a clean form UI to enter my product prompt | 2 | Responsive input, error handling |
| UI-2 | As a user, I want to select a template before generating a PRD | 2 | Dropdown with at least 3 templates (CRUD app, AI agent, SaaS) |
| UI-3 | As a user, I want to log in and see my past projects | 3 | Auth via Supabase, projects listed with links |
| BE-9 | As a dev, I want to define and use prompt templates dynamically | 3 | Templates stored in DB, injected into model prompt |
| QA-1 | As a QA, I want to test flows on staging with sample inputs | 2 | All flows pass: input â†’ generate â†’ export â†’ view past projects |
| PM-1 | As a PM, I want a README and deployment guide written | 2 | Markdown docs complete with setup and testing instructions |

### âœ… Deliverables

- Next.js frontend
- Auth via Supabase
- Prompt Template logic
- Final QA pass and release candidate

## ðŸ§ª TDD/BDD Coverage per Sprint

| Sprint | Unit Tests | BDD Tests | Coverage Goal |
|--------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | 10+ | 3 Scenarios | 85% |
| 2 | 15+ | 4 Scenarios | 90% |
| 3 | 10+ | 3 Scenarios | 95% |

---

## âœ… Definition of Done (DoD)

- All features covered by unit and BDD tests
- SSCS-compliant formatting
- API + UI documented
- CI/CD runs green
- Live demo deployable from `main`
